# Book Club
BE Mod 2 Week 2/3 Paired Project

## Background and Description

This purpose of this application is for users to browse and review books. The primary goals of this project are to test your ability to set up many-to-many relationships and accessing attributes through multiple model relationships.

## Learning Goals for this Project

- creation of a basic Rails web application
- implementing basic MVC structure to your project
- save and retrieve data from a database
- display content on a web page with some very basic styling
- learning how to test your code effectively at a Controller and a Model level

## Requirements

- must use Rails 5.1.x
- must use PostgreSQL
- all controller and model code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- must use some amount of HTML and CSS layout
- must deploy project to Heroku


## Not Allowed

- ask instructors in your public channel before adding any additional gems to your project
- do not use JavaScript to sort content on a page


## User Stories

These user stories may be worked on in any order that makes sense to your team. The most optimal order may not be a top-to-bottom approach.

User Story 1
Deploy your application to Heroku

As a visitor or user of the site
I will perform all user stories
By visiting the application on Heroku.
Localhost is fine for development, but
the application must be hosted on Heroku.
```

---

## Navigation
This series of stories will set up a navigation bar at the top of the screen and present links and information to users of your site.

There is no requirement that the nav bar be "locked" to the top of the screen.

### Completion of these stories will encompass the following ideas:

- the navigation is built into app/views/layouts/application.html.erb or loaded into that file as a partial
- you write a single set of tests that simply click on a link and expect that your current path is what you expect to see
- your nav tests don't need to check any content on the pages, just that current_path is what you expect

You will need to set up some basic routing and empty controller actions and empty action view files.
